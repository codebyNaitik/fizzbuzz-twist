# FizzBuzz Twist 🌀

This is a loop-based Python challenge that combines:

- Classic **FizzBuzz**
- **Prime number detection**
- Clean logic using conditionals and functions

## 🔍 How it works

The program loops from 1 to 100 and prints:
- `Fizz` if divisible by 3
- `Buzz` if divisible by 5
- `FizzBuzz` if divisible by both
- `Prime` if the number is prime
- Otherwise, it prints the number itself

## 🧠 Technologies

- Language: Python 3.13+
- Editor: VS Code
- Git/GitHub for version control and hosting
